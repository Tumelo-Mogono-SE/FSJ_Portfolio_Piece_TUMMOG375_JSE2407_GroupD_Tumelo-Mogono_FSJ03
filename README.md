# Usage 
This Next.js e-commerce website allows users to browse and interact with a variety of products fetched from an API.

* The homepage displays a list of products in card format, with equal-sized cards for a clean and consistent layout.
* Users can navigate through multiple pages of products using a pagination component that dynamically updates the page URL based on user interaction.
* Users can navigate between pictures if a product has more than one image on the home page product cards.
* Users can access product details by click on them.
* Inside product details users can see product gallery, details and reviews.
* User can filter products based on categories selected.
* User can search products using related words.
* User can sort the products on the home page based on prices.
* Users can sort reviews based on rating and dates.

# Area of mastery
Through this Next.js project, I have gained and demonstrated strong mastery in various areas of web development, particularly in building both client-side and server-side rendered applications. I successfully integrated pagination, managed complex state using React hooks like useState and useEffect, and developed dynamic components such as image galleries and product detail pages. I also learned how to effectively handle asynchronous data fetching, implement loading skeletons, and manage errors to ensure a seamless user experience, all of which are critical to modern web development.

Additionally, I deepened my understanding of Next.js-specific features like the App Directory and structured my project with reusable components, clean routing, improving the optimization of SEO's, caching, refactoring client side rendering into server side rendering and clear documentation. I focused on performance optimization and scalability, particularly in crafting e-commerce platforms, which are increasingly important in fast-growing sectors such as small business and fintech in South Africa. This project showcases not only my technical abilities but also my understanding of how to create user-friendly applications that meet real-world needs.

I learned how to create my own endpoint for my api and how to integrate my firebase database to my Next application along with using authentification and how to post data in an already existing data.

# Project Process

# Challenges
In this project I didn't struggle alot, I had to be more innovative in solving some problems such as fixing the pagination whenever a user filters product and the pagination should change the number of pages available. I slightly struggled with converting from the provided api to my own api end points , which almost lead me to changing my code alot. I also struggled with fixing alot of bugs I found such as how to handle my code on vercel vs on my local environment.

# Feedback
This project opened my mind to other diverse features I had never worked with, more specifically when trying to convert client side pages into server side pages, implementing my api endpoint and working with backend for the first time. But in overall I enjoyed working on implementing the user stories and also improving upon the work I had also did.
