# Tech Stack 
* HTML
* CSS Tailwind
* JavaScript
* Next.js
* React.js
* Flowbite react (Library)

# Content
* Home Page
* Product List with cards of individual products.
* Product cards that contain carousels for products containing more than one image.
* A page that displays product details.
* The product page contains a gallery with all the images.

# Usage 
This Next.js e-commerce website allows users to browse and interact with a variety of products fetched from an API.

* The homepage displays a list of products in card format, with equal-sized cards for a clean and consistent layout.
* Users can navigate through multiple pages of products using a pagination component that dynamically updates the page URL based on user interaction.
* Users can navigate between pictures if a product has more than one image on the home page product cards.

# Area of mastery
Through this Next.js project, I have gained and demonstrated strong mastery in various areas of web development, particularly in building both client-side and server-side rendered applications. I successfully integrated pagination, managed complex state using React hooks like useState and useEffect, and developed dynamic components such as image galleries and product detail pages. I also learned how to effectively handle asynchronous data fetching, implement loading skeletons, and manage errors to ensure a seamless user experience, all of which are critical to modern web development.

Additionally, I deepened my understanding of Next.js-specific features like the App Directory and structured my project with reusable components, clean routing, and clear documentation. I focused on performance optimization and scalability, particularly in crafting e-commerce platforms, which are increasingly important in fast-growing sectors such as small business and fintech in South Africa. This project showcases not only my technical abilities but also my understanding of how to create user-friendly applications that meet real-world needs.

# Project Process

# Challenges
I struggled alot with some of my pre-build components, which felt quite restrictive, which led me to not use some of them. I also struggled with pagination as integrating pagination with proper state management and URL manipulation was another challenge, as it required updating page numbers without reloading the entire page while keeping the state consistent.

# Feedback
This was a great introduction challenge project for Next.js, I really enjoyed it. The feature of not having to do alot of installation was a good addition to this framework. I really enjoyed working on this project aside from the fact that I only started late.
